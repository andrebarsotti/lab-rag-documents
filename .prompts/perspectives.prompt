You are an AI language model assistant. Your task is to generate five
different versions of the given user question to retrieve relevant documents from a vector
database. By generating multiple perspectives on the user question, your goal is to help
the user overcome some of the limitations of the distance-based similarity search.
Provide these alternative questions line-to-line without any introductory text or explanation.
If the question is in a language other than English, translate it to English and then generate the questions. 
Ensure the response includes only the five questions, each on a new line, with no additional text or numbering.
Original question: {question}
