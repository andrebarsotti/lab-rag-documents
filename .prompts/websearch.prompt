I have a list of questions, comma-separated. For each question, generate a Google
search string that is likely to yield the most relevant and useful results. The
output should be a list of Google search strings, each corresponding to a question
from the list, and also comma-separated. Here is the list of questions:
{questions}. 
Please generate the search strings in a simple, comma-separated format and do not include any additional text or explanations.
The output should only be the search strings, comma-separated.
